# AI_Powered_Network_Analytics_BDAA_SP26
Project repo to develop a AI driven Network Analytics platform/dashboard

## BDAA SP26 Meeting 2

## Tools

Project Framework - ChatPRD to get the interpretation for the project down proper: Audience, Design, Success, Problem, Requirements, Constraints - Just lets us get a proper structure for our project that we are planning to work on that we can feed to other agents to help us out

Google Stitch - Designing the project UI generatively using prompt engineering (Goal, Layout, Styling) - Image generation for a possible UI layout that we could use for our finalized project

Lovable - Product Requirements Documents + Google Stitch Output -> Prototypes for our website (or at least the visuals of it), connect the project shit to GitHub repo so w can work on it with our IDE lowkey -> Move it onto Cursor and clone the repo after actually making sure you can get the python environment set up, you can then interact with the agent to code your project however you want!


## Idea

Tools to document my code and the framework will help me think of what my project goals should be. 

## Problems
1) Take in files that would represent possible network data that I could do analytics on and automate with AI - training and testing data
2) Defining my problem statement, what do I want my project to exactly be? What do I want my AI agent to do with the Network Data for what kind of field?
3) If the application is dependent on what data I can get my hands on which is reliable enough to actually AI with, then I need to work my way backwards when starting to think about the project itself - a lot of research is needed. 
4) Ideal goal would be to have a real time network analytics dashboard (something like down detector) but more varied? and more general purpose! I dont want it to exactly focus on the internet itself but it might have to be limited to that

## Requirements
1) DO NOT want it to be medical. I want it to be primarily concerned with Networks - of any kind really, a general platform for Networks but also want it to interpret what it actually does.
2) That is hard to think of in a way but I feel I can about this piece by wise.
3) I also want to have a Dashboard where it parses thorough Network Data using Statistical Analysis using the models I'm fitting in my statistical analysis of networks class. So maybe an option to explore the Machine Learning fitted Models/ Statistically Fitted Models

## Agentic Tools

## Agentic AI : Autonomous systems that independently pursues goals and plans ahead to work on problems (Look at the Agentic AI Workshop thread) (Workflow given in slides)

## MCP/ Model Context Protocol: Bridge between AI model and specific project data (APIs, Databases, other shit)
1) Linking AI to the MCP servers to get access to specific project related functions it might need to use
2) Incorporate that in cursor : Tools and MCP -> Add MCP

## N8N : Workflow automation platform, automate repetitive tasks, visual node editor
- Workflows start with a trigger followed by a series of actions
- Visually can automate the workflow (e.g. trigger -> get an email, use Gmail MCP to categorize email and then continue the workflow)
